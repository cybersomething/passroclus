    How is the strength of a passphrase calculated?
  </h5>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p class="card-text">The strength of the entered passphrase is calculated by using entropy. Entropy is a measurement of how predictable a password is, however a high entropy score does not necessarily mean that the password is strong. It may be an easy to guess passphrase such as Password123 or may already be in a breached password list.</p>

   Why passphrase and not password?
  </h5>
  <div class="card-body">
    <p class="card-text">In simple terms, passwords are insecure and difficult to remember. Many password policies require symbols, upper and lower case letters, numbers and tend to be random gibberish. This is difficult for a human to remember, but it's also easier for a computer to crack.</p><p> Passphrases such as "RandomHorseBatteryStaple" are easy for humans to remeber and contain more entropy than a random password, which makes it more difficult for computers to guess.</p>
